-- Files:

   (1) Makefile
   (2) driver_mrvlFlashBCH_linuxCHG.cpp
	--> C code main()
   (3) mrvlFlashBCH.h
	--> header included by the driver
   (4) bchEncInput.txt
	--> input file taken by the driver

-- To run:

   (0) (make sure bchEncInput.txt is under the dir)
   (1) % make
	--> create bch_test
   (2) % bch_test
	--> read in "bchEncInput.txt" and output "encodedOut.txt" which includes data and parity

-- modify driver_mrvlFlashBCH_linuxCHG.cpp for different codeword size and T value:

   (1) modify "codeword_length_bch" for codeword size (number of bits input to the encoder)
   (2) modify "t_bch" for BCH T value
