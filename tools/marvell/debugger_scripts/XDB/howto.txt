How to use XDB for Debug and for recovering and programming U-Boot image:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assumptions:
------------

- This documentation refers to XDB scripts located under <u_boot root dir>\tools\marvell\debugger_scripts\XDB\
- This documentation refer to Armada XP, Armada 370, AvantaLP, Armada 375, and Armada 38x platforms.
The <u_boot root dir>\tools\marvell\debugger_scripts\ includes the following files:

PJ4:
	- ARMADA1000_V7.xsf
Armada-XP:
	- init_AXP_DDR_V7.xdb
Armada-370:
	- init_A370_DDR_V7.xdb
Cortex-A9:
	- MV_CortexA9_SMP.xsf
	- MV_CortexA9_UP.xsf
Avanta-LP:
	- ALP_FastPath.xdb
	- ALP_XBAR.xdb
Armada-375:
	- A375_FastPath.xdb
Armada-38x:
	- A38x_staticInit.xdb
howto.txt

- A bin_hdr.elf file exist under:
	- <u_boot root directory>\tools\marvell\bin_hdr\
	- <release directory>\binaries[release number][board name]\bin_hdr\bin_hdr.elf
- A valid serial connection is configured between the host and target
- XDB software version 5.4.001 or later is installed and running

XDB configuration steps to load U-Boot Image:
--------------------------------------------------------

JTAG Connection:
----------------

1. Connect the Marvell JTAG POD to the target board.

2. To Launch the XDB start-up menu , Double click on the *.xsf script under <u_boot root directory>\tools\marvell\debugger_scripts\XDB directory.

3. Make sure that "connection type" of the first core is set to "Reset SOC & stop", "connection type" is located under the most left "CS-JTAG" tab in the settings window of the startup menu (appears when clicking settings from the startup menu). Please note that this is needed to be done only once.

4. Click on the Start button from the startup menu, this will launch the XDB tool itself.

5. Wait for a connection to be established, the Command window in the tool appear by    default and provide a feedback on the connection status:

	- If the connection was successful a "xdb>" prompt will appear at the bottom of the command window.
	- If "xdb_InReset>" / "xdb_nocomm>" prompt appears at the bottom of the command window, this is an indication that an error happened:
		make sure the board is powered, the POD is properly connected, and that you are using the correct .xsf script.

Note: If a reset is not desired when connecting to the platform, choose the "Try Hot Connect & Stop" option at step 3. this is assuming the system has a valid image is running.

DRAM Initialization:
--------------------

6. To initialize memory, do the following:
	- Click on the file -> Batch.
	- The "Execute Batch file" menu will appear,  browse to  <u_boot root dir>\tools\marvell\debugger_scripts\XDB choose the relevant .xdb script
		- Hit the "OK" button.

7. In the XDB command window the user will see a log starting with: "BATCH "<path to the script from the previous step>"" , and ending with the "xdb >" prompt.

8. The user should see the following pattern on the terminal connected to the target:
"
High speed PHY - Version: x.x.x (COM-PHY-Vxx)
High speed PHY - Ended Successfully
DDR3 Training Sequence - Ver X.x.x
   .....
   ....
DDR3 Training Sequence - Ended Successfully
...
...
“
This is an indication that the DRAM and PCI SERDES configuration were initialized and it can be used to load the u-Boot.

9. To load the u-Boot do the following:

-	From the XDB tool main menu Click on the File -> Load.
- 	The “Load” menu will appear.
- 	Click the “Symbols And Data” option.
-	Click the Browse button, browse to the appropriate elf u-Boot image under the <u_boot root directory>\Images directory.
-	Check the "Download", and "initfile" options in the “Load” menu, and click “Ok”.
-	Wait until the download is completed. download progress is presented in percentage in the bottom right       coroner ( appears only when download in progress).
-	The debugger will launch a browser window requesting the user to direct it to the source for start.s (the first file to run). This is located  root directory <u_boot root directory>\arch\arm\cpu\armv7\start.S for u-boot-2011.12 and above. In case of following this Precedure to "Running / Recovering u-Boot" (see below), no need to direct the debugger to the source, in case of debugging this is a must-do step.


Running / Recovering u-Boot
----------------------------------
To Recover/ burn a u-Boot image to the flash DRAM Initialization:

1. press the Run icon ( the green light), or press “Ctrl +r”  this will run the selected  u-Boot image from the memory. the u-boot will run, and a normal u-boot plot will appear on the Serial connection.
2. use the “bubt” command to flash a u-boot image – refer to the “How to upgrade to a new version of U-Boot” in the u-boot release notes.


U-Boot Debugging
-----------------------
XDB provides full debugging capability ( step though source / assembler, adding breakpoints, and variable / register evaluation)
throughout the U-boot run.Here are the setups to do this ( after DRAM Initialization):


- Once the user directed the debugger to the source for start.s, the debugger will be able to automatically load  the source as needed by the user execution follow. No extra intervention needed.

Debugging basics:

- User can run in source mode / assembler mode as needed – user can chose to show either, or both windows by clicking  on display -> assembler / display -> source from the main XDB window.
- The Run menu in the main window includes the run control options ( run, step, step into ..and more), this can be done in either  the source or assembler based on the selection in “Display” menu.
- Debug menu in the main XDB window has the option to set breakpoint(s):
	- Click the “Code” tap to set the breakpoint in a specific address.
	- Click the “Data” tap, and then click browse to set the breakpoint at the start of a specific function.
	- Click the “Hard” option if you wish to use a Hardware breakpoint.
- The Display ->Cores option will show the available cores in a Multicore environment and their status. Choose the core you wish to debug by double clicking on it in the cores window.
- If loading the symbols only is desired do the following:
From the XDB tool main menu Click on the File -> Load (don't initialize the DRAM, only load the symbols).
	- The “Load” menu will appear.
	- Click the “Symbols And Data” option.
	- Click the Browse button, browse to the appropriate elf u-Boot image under the <u_boot root directory> /Images directory.	-make sure to Uncheck the "Download" option.



Note: refer to XDB documentation for full tool capabilities.
